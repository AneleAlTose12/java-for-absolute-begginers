/**
 * There are four operators that are used to construct
 * complex conditions; two of them are bitwise operations that can be reused: &(AND)
 * and |(OR); but they require evaluation of all the parts of the condition. The operators
 * &&(AND) and ||(OR) have the same effect as the other ones, but the difference is they do
 * not require evaluation of all the expression, which is why they are also called shortcut
 * operators. To explain the difficult behavior of these operators, there is a typical example.
 * Basically, we declare a list of ten terms (some of them null) and a method to generate a
 * random index, used to select an item from the list. Then we test the selected element from
 * the list to see if it is not null and equal to an expected value. If both conditions are true,
 * then a message is printed in the console. Letâ€™s start with the first example.
