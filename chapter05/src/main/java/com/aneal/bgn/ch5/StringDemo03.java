 * When a new String object is created using the new operator, the JVM allocate new

 * This results in every String object created like this having its own memory region with
 * its own address. That is why if we were to compare variable text22 and variable text23,
 * from the initial code sample, we would expect their references to be different, but the
 * objects should be equal.
