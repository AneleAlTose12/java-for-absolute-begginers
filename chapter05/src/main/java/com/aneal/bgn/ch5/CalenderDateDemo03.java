/**
 * The java.util.Date class and the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class are not
 * thread safe, so in complex applications with multiple execution threads, developers
 * must synchronize access to those type of objects explicitly. Objects of those types are not
 * immutable, and working with time zones is a pain. That is why in Java 8, a new API to
 * model calendar-date operations was introduced. It is better designed, and date instances
 * are thread-safe and immutable. The central classes for the API are java.time.LocalDate
 * and java.time.LocalDateTime, used to model calendar dates and calendar dates with
 * time. Letâ€™s see how the code to get the current date and to create a custom date looks
 * with the new API.
